# Australia-Rainfall-Prediction-Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and develop a machine learning model that predicts whether it will rain the next day in Australia. Using historical weather data, the model classifies the target variable RainTomorrow (Yes/No) based on several meteorological features, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall from the current day.
